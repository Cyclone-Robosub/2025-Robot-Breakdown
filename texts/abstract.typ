Cyclone RoboSub is an interdisciplinary student design team that has dedicated the past two years to designing, manufacturing, and programming an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). This AUV is engineered to compete in the 2025 RoboSub Competition, where it will autonomously traverse a challenging course and complete various tasks.

Equipped with eight thrusters for propulsion and an array of onboard sensors for navigation, the vehicle leverages advanced feedback control and decision-making algorithms, while a watertight enclosure safeguards sensitive electrical systems. Beyond the competition, Cyclone RoboSub is collaborating with UC Davis faculty to adapt the vehicle for upcoming field deployments and environmental data collection.
