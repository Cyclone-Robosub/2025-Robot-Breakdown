    Beyond the competition, Cyclone RoboSub is contributing to environmental research efforts through field deployments and interdepartmental collaborations. Equipped with sensors to measure temperature, depth, pH, and dissolved oxygen, the vehicle can collect environmental data and is scheduled to take two transects along the UC Davis Arboretum. The team is also exploring opportunities to contribute to marine science research at the Bodega Marine Lab.
