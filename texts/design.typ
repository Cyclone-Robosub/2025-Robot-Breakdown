= Mechanical Vehicle Design
Our chosen thruster configuration allows for six degrees of freedom while its symmetry simplifies vehicle control and maneuverability. Designed to be neutrally buoyant and have a low center of mass, the vehicle naturally corrects errors in orientation. All electronics are housed in an acrylic tube with Blue Robotics WetLink penetrators to connect cables to the external environment.
