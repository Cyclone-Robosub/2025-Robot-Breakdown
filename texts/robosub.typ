    Teams from around the world compete with custom AUVs which complete tasks such as manipulating objects, maneuvering around obstacles, and firing torpedoes. Our team prioritized navigation-based tasks, eliminating the need for precise manipulation. Cyclone RoboSub will be competing for the first time this year and debuting our first vehicle vehicle!
